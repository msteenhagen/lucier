An Applescript to perform Alvin Lucier's 'I am sitting in a room'

Read here about the work: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Sitting_in_a_Room

The script is crude but does the job. It controls QuickTime Player, starting an audio recording, which is subsequently played back and recorded into a second audio recording. This second recording is then played back and recorded by overwriting the first. And this goes on for a while. 

The script was created in collaboration with Guy Dammann, for a performance of the work in a seminar at Uppsala University. 

The Uppsala performance went well, but in trying out the script I would occasionally run into trouble with audio settings and audio drivers. This would lead either to an 'unable to record' message from QuickTime Player, or, worse even, in one of the audio files containing no more than a deafening noise. So make sure to test before using in front of an audience (unless you like that kind of embarassment).
